# CodeChef-Code
These are some snippets of code that I have worked on for CodeChef, a competitive coding platform.
I like to do these challenges in my free time. 

The ones coded in Java were created when I was in high school. Now, as a college student (July 2022), I prefer to code in C++ but as I learn different languages in school, I will practice coding in different languages. Most of the Java code is beginner level. A few of the C++ code is also beginner level. If you want to see more advanced code, I suggest you go through the more recent C++ code as I will be tackling more difficult challenges as time goes on.

This is mainly for me to keep track of my progress as a programmer. Hopefully, I'll be partaking in more complex, difficult challenges in the future!
